React 1:

- Network request for reading data
- Displaying and laying out the information received from a 3rd API
- Implementing industry standards in regards to the way that your React Components are
- architected and developed, i.e. hooks are used and implemented correctly
- Proper usage of React Router
- Forms in the app are managed well, including the use of form validation
- Your application should be built to demonstrate that your app solves the problem your team set out to solve.
  - Focus the displaying of information and working with other members of your team to ensure that users can seamlessly navigate through the tools that you’re building.

```Student incorperated a third party event/animation library like unto Greensock, Anime, React-motion etc.
Student was able to architect components to be easily reused. Student used advanced React techniques like the composition pattern, custom hooks, render props, HOCs, etc.
Not only are standard network request techniques employed, the code is organized in such a fashion that the student demonstrated proper use of container vs presentational components or other industry standards, conventions or patterns.
Student showed great insight in setting up the state management for the app's forms. Form validation is in place for all fields, and covers all use cases. Loading states and success/error notifications are in place and add to the overall UX of the app.
```

React 2:

- Planning and developing a state management system for your application
- Handle HTTP requests for all CRUD methods
- Implementing client-side authentication in conjunction with the BE developer
- Implementing industry standards in regards to the way that you manage state in your React application.
- Implement some testing into your application
- Your application should be built to demonstrate that your app solves the problem your team set out to solve. Focus the displaying of information and working with other members of your team to ensure that users can seamlessly navigate through the tools that you’re building.

```App is deployed, and continuous deployment is set up in a manner that is conducive to a team project environment. Project is organized well on GitHub. Extra considerations were made to help all team members understand how to contribute easily to the project, no matter their role.
Pages making HTTP requests do so in a logical manner that is cohesive with the app's state management system. Student showed great care and insight when handling token authentication. Student used a modular system for all requests (e.g. like a  useFetch custom hook).
